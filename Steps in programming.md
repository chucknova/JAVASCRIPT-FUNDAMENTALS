1. Understand the problem
Before touching code, be clear on what you're actually trying to solve. What goes in? What should come out? What are the edge cases? A lot of bugs are born here — people start coding before they fully understand what they're building.

2. Break it down
Split the big problem into smaller, manageable pieces. A calculator isn't one problem — it's "display numbers", "handle operators", "calculate a result", "handle errors" and so on. This is called decomposition and it's probably the most important skill in programming.

3. Plan / pseudocode
Sketch out your logic in plain language before writing real code. Don't worry about syntax yet, just think through the steps. This is where you catch logical problems cheaply, before you're knee-deep in code.

4. Write the code
Now translate your plan into actual syntax. Start simple and get something working, even if it's rough. A working ugly solution beats a perfect unfinished one.

5. Test it
Does it do what you expected? Try normal cases, then try to break it — empty inputs, zero, huge numbers, clicking buttons in weird orders. Bugs you find yourself are free. Bugs users find are expensive.

6. Debug
Something will go wrong. Read the error, form a hypothesis about what's causing it, test that hypothesis, fix it. console.log is your best friend early on.

7. Refactor
Once it works, clean it up. Remove repetition, rename confusing variables, simplify logic. Code is read far more than it's written, so clarity matters.

8. Repeat
You rarely go through these steps just once in a straight line. You'll plan, write a bit, discover you misunderstood something, replan, write more. It's a loop, not a checklist.
